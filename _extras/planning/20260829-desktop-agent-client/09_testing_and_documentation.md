# Testing and documentation (both repositories)

This is the quality contract for [`00_master_plan.md`](./00_master_plan.md).
A sprint is not done when pairing works on one laptop. It is done when this
file’s gate is green and the sprint’s documentation table is updated.

---

## 1. Principles

1. **Two repos, two gates, and never in the same PR.** Touching `synaplan/`
   runs the Synaplan unfiltered gate. Touching `synaplan-desktop` runs
   `make ci-local` there. Under the server-first order there is **no
   cross-repo change to sequence**: all of Phase A merges before the client
   repo exists, and Phase B only touches `synaplan/` for documentation
   (`DC5`, `DC21`).
2. **Unfiltered gate = CI.** `phpunit --filter` and `vitest path` are
   diagnostic only.
3. **Deterministic and offline in CI.** No live LLM, no Graph, no Agent37,
   no real LibreOffice on the PR runner (except an optional nightly).
   Fixture upstreams and tempdirs.
4. **Characterization is a contract.** This epic must **not** change
   sorter / classifier / planner snapshots. If a PR does, it is out of
   scope — stop and split.
5. **Widget invariant.** No Desktop UI, job hooks, or new i18n keys under
   `widget.*`. Value-only edits to shared keys follow the streamlining
   compatibility rules.
6. **Five locales.** Any user-visible string: `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `tr`
   in the **same** change, in whichever repo owns the UI.
7. **OpenAPI → Zod** on every new `/api/v1/desktop` field, then `vue-tsc`.
8. **Mobile impact.** New `synaplan/` paths go in
   `.github/mobile-impact-policy.json`. Default: PHP = `backend-only`;
   Channels Desktop page = `ota-candidate`.
9. **Galera.** Prod migrations: raw idempotent `addSql` only.
10. **No secrets in fixtures.** Pairing codes = `AB3K7Q2M`; keys =
    `sk_test_…`; URLs = `https://synaplan.test`.
11. **Path confinement tests are not optional, and they are not Linux-only.**
    A sprint that touches Read/Write/Bash without the shared escape corpus
    (`tests/confinement/cases.toml`) running on Linux, Windows, **and** macOS
    is incomplete. A control verified on one OS is an assumption on the other
    two (C11).
12. **A consumer-less server feature must prove itself twice.** Phase A ships
    before any client, so every Phase A behaviour needs (a) a PHPUnit test and
    (b) an assertion in the fake-device harness (`DS17`). “We will find out
    when the client calls it” is not a test strategy.
13. **The frozen contract is test input, not test output.** After `DS18`, the
    fixtures in `_devextras/testing/desktop/fixtures/` are asserted against
    the live schema on the server side and vendored verbatim on the client
    side. A fixture edit is a `protocol: 2` decision (C9).
14. **Three platforms, one gate.** Every client PR runs its unit tests on
    Linux, Windows, and macOS. A client feature is done only when it is done on
    all three (C10); “Windows to follow” is a red PR, not a follow-up ticket.
    Platform behaviour is asserted against **fixture filesystems**, never
    against whatever happens to be installed on the GitHub runner image.
15. **Per-OS tests must not silently agree.** If one implementation choice
    makes a platform-specific case green everywhere, the case is not exercising
    the behaviour: Linux must compare byte-exact where Windows and macOS
    case-fold, and the corpus asserts both directions.

## 2. Mandatory gates

### 2.1 `synaplan/` (every server PR)

From `synaplan/` with Docker up:

```bash
make lint \
  && make -C backend phpstan \
  && make test \
  && docker compose exec -T frontend npm run check:types \
  && make -C frontend test
```

If OpenAPI changed:

```bash
make -C frontend generate-schemas
docker compose exec -T frontend npm run check:types
```

If you believe routing could have moved (it should not):

```bash
docker compose exec -T backend \
  ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Characterization/RoutingCharacterizationTest.php
```

Diff must be empty. Do not re-record.

Planning-only changes under `_devextras/planning/` do not require the
PHP gate.

### 2.2 `synaplan-desktop/` (every client PR)

```bash
make ci-local
```

Must include at least: lint/format, `vue-tsc` (or equivalent), unit tests
(Rust + TS), the confinement corpus, the no-shell grep guard (C12), and a
debug Tauri/Vite build.

**The CI job runs this on three runners** — `ubuntu-latest`,
`windows-latest`, `macos-latest` — for every PR. This supersedes the earlier
"unit tests must run on Linux in every PR; Windows and macOS can be
`workflow_dispatch`". Full matrix and the rationale:
[`13_cross_platform.md`](./13_cross_platform.md) §10.

| Job | Runners | When | Blocking |
| --- | ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Lint + types | Linux | Every PR | Yes |
| Unit tests + confinement corpus | Linux, Windows, macOS | Every PR | Yes |
| Debug build | Linux, Windows, macOS | Every PR | Yes |
| Hermetic pptx fixture | Linux, Windows, macOS | Every PR (from `DC18`) | Yes |
| Release build + installers | Linux, Windows, macOS | Tag | Release |
| Sign + notarize | Windows, macOS | Tag | Release |
| Official pptx with LibreOffice | Linux | Nightly | Report only |

If runner minutes become a genuine constraint, cut the debug build on
Windows/macOS to `push`-only. **Never** the confinement corpus.

### 2.3 Phase gate (replaces the old cross-repo dance)

Before the first `DC*` PR exists, confirm on `main`:

1. Every `DS*` step merged; breakdown §0 status table fully ticked for Phase A.
2. Full unfiltered Synaplan gate green on `main`, characterization diff empty.
3. `_devextras/testing/desktop/fake-device.sh` green against a local stack,
   including every refusal row in sprint A3 §2.6.
4. Flag off on a fresh install: no nav item, `/api/v1/desktop/*` 404,
   `tools/list` unchanged, reaper a no-op (C8).
5. `docs/DESKTOP.md` published and fixtures committed (C9).

Only then create `synaplan-desktop` (`DC1`).

Within Phase B, a client PR needs `make ci-local` only. The two
documentation steps (`DC5`, `DC21`) are docs-only `synaplan/` PRs and take
the docs path, not the PHP gate.

---

## 3. Compatibility regression suite (every `synaplan/` sprint)

Maps to [`00_master_plan.md`](./00_master_plan.md) §10.

| Inv. | Test | Where |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| C1 | Empty-scope and legacy webhook keys still reach `/v1` and `/mcp` | New scope matrix + existing gateway tests |
| C2 | `/v1` and `/mcp` `tools/list` are additive | Existing contract tests; snapshot **superset** after Sprint A3 |
| C3 | Routing characterization byte-identical | `tests/Characterization/` — do not touch |
| C4 | Widget E2E / widget i18n namespace unchanged | Existing widget specs; PR review of `en.json` keys |
| C5 | New paths classified; `node scripts/mobile-impact.mjs` if required | `.github/mobile-impact-policy.json` |
| C6 | `security.yaml` only adds desktop routes on existing API firewalls | PR review + login E2E still green |
| C7 | M365 / Saved Tasks / Synamail tests untouched and green | Do not edit those suites unless fixing a true break |
| C8 | Flag off on `main` is inert: no nav, 404 routes, `tools/list` unchanged, reaper no-op | Flag-off variants of every Phase A endpoint test + a `tools/list` snapshot with the flag off |
| C9 | The A3 contract does not move in Phase B | Server: fixtures asserted against live OpenAPI/MCP schema. Client: vendored fixtures compared to the recorded source commit |
| C10 | Feature parity Windows / macOS / Linux | Client PR checklist row; any capability behind a platform check must name where it is hidden and why |
| C11 | Confinement corpus green on three runners | `tests/confinement/cases.toml` in the required CI job (§2.2) |
| C12 | No shell is ever constructed | CI grep guard for `sh -c`, `bash -c`, `cmd /c`, `powershell -Command`, `osascript -e` in client sources |

---

## 4. Test matrix by sprint

| Sprint | Repo | Automated | Manual / evidence |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | ----------------- |
| A1 | synaplan | Scope matrix, flag resolver, grandfather keys | — |
| A2 | synaplan | Pairing Redis TTL, revoke, OpenAPI, Vue + i18n | `pair.sh` against the demo user |
| A3 | synaplan | Jobs, lease, expiry, MCP tools, enqueue 404, flag-off `tools/list`, ignored extra keys, fixture-vs-schema | `fake-device.sh`: full loop + every refusal row |
| B1 | desktop | Pairing, secret-store double, `app_dirs` per OS, plaintext-fallback refusal, SSE chat, vendored-fixture parity | One real PONG turn (one OS) |
| B2 | desktop | Loader, confinement corpus (all rows, three OSes), tool loop, no-shell guard, env leak, process-tree kill | — |
| B3 | desktop | Archive corpus: `../`, backslash entry, symlink/hardlink, ADS, reserved names, case collision, zip bomb, long path, atomic rollback; git URL parse without a `git` binary | Install fixture zip in the UI on each OS |
| B4 | desktop | Parse pptx SKILL.md, doctor against fixture filesystems (Store stub, `py` launcher, CLT shim, bundle `soffice`), hermetic pptx, `curl` denied | **§1.5 matrix filled on all three OSes**, including the two negative rows |
| B5 | desktop | Check-in mock, unknown/disabled skill, ignore `command`, unattended default, autostart enable/disable per OS, single instance | Queue from web → file in chat on each OS, plus a screenshotted refusal |
| B6 | desktop | Installer smoke test per OS | Signed/notarized install with no unpassable warning ([`13_cross_platform.md`](./13_cross_platform.md) §11) |

Phase A rows carry both an automated and a harness assertion (principle 12);
Phase B rows reuse the Phase A fixtures rather than inventing payloads, and
every Phase B automated column runs on three runners (principle 14).

### 4.1 Manual platform matrix

Automated tests cannot see a SmartScreen prompt or a Gatekeeper refusal. The
per-release human checklist lives in
[`13_cross_platform.md`](./13_cross_platform.md) §11 and is pasted, filled in,
into the release PR. It is first required at Sprint B4 (`DC18`) and in full at
every release from Sprint B6 on.

## 5. Documentation table (update in the same PR)

| Doc | Owner | When |
| --- | ----- | ---- |
| `docs/OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API.md` scopes note | synaplan | `DS4` |
| `docs/DESKTOP.md` — what it is, pairing, flag, **job contract** | synaplan | `DS18` (created here, not in Phase B) |
| `docs/ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBLE_API.md` Related | synaplan | `DS18` |
| `_devextras/testing/desktop/` README + fixtures | synaplan | `DS17`, `DS18` |
| `docs/DESKTOP.md` — install / pairing walkthrough | synaplan | `DC5` (docs-only PR) |
| `docs/DESKTOP.md` — queue walkthrough, Outlook honesty | synaplan | `DC21` (docs-only PR) |
| `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | desktop | `DC1` (repo birth) |
| `docs/PLATFORMS.md` — per-OS build prerequisites, install paths, known traps | desktop | `DC1`, extended by `DC22`, `DC26`, `DC28` |
| `docs/BUNDLED_SKILLS.md` | desktop | `DC15` |
| `docs/DESKTOP.md` — per-OS install + signing status, and what is builds-only (ARM) | synaplan | `DC5`, updated at `DC28` |
| This planning folder status lines | synaplan | When a step merges |

User-facing `docs/**` rides with the code PR. Do not “document in a follow-up”.

---

## 6. Definition of done (every `DS*` / `DC*` step)

1. Gate of the touched repo is green (unfiltered).
2. New branches have tests; security fixes have a regression test.
3. OpenAPI + schemas if HTTP changed.
4. Five locales if copy changed.
5. PR lists which invariants the diff can touch.
6. Characterization diff is empty.
7. Docs in the same PR.
8. No `sk_` or pairing codes in the diff.
9. `DS*` only: the flag-off behaviour is asserted, and the harness covers any
   new device-facing behaviour.
10. `DC*` only: no `synaplan/` file in the diff unless this is `DC5` / `DC21`.
11. `DC*` only: green on **all three** runners, no new platform branch outside
    `src-tauri/src/platform/`, and any deliberate platform difference is named
    in the PR with the reason it is not a C10 violation.

---

## 7. Cache / local traps

Synaplan: after `docker compose down`, reset `var/cache/test` as in
`AGENTS.md`.

Desktop: tests must redirect **every** home-ish variable to a temp path —
`HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `APPDATA`,
`LOCALAPPDATA`, `USERPROFILE` — so a developer's real installation is never
read or written. Setting only `HOME` works on Linux and silently uses the real
profile on Windows.

Platform-specific traps that will otherwise waste an afternoon:

- **Windows runners have a short temp path but a low path limit.** Long-path
  cases need the `\\?\` prefix, not a shorter tempdir.
- **macOS runners canonicalize `/tmp` to `/private/tmp`.** A test that stores an
  uncanonicalized root will fail there and nowhere else — which is the bug the
  corpus exists to catch, so do not "fix" it by relaxing the assertion.
- **Windows file locking** means a test that leaves a child process running
  cannot delete its tempdir. Assert the process-tree kill, then clean up.
- **The secret store needs a session.** Use the in-memory double in CI; the
  real Secret Service is not available on a headless Linux runner (which is
  also why the plaintext fallback exists and why it is tested as *refused* by
  default).
